1) Unemployment Rate Analysis : The unemployment rate is calculated based on a particular region, so to analyze unemployment I will be using an unemployment dataset of India. The dataset I’m using here contains data on India’s unemployment rate during Covid-19.
The purpose of this dataset is to facilitate research and analysis in of  unemployment rate based on different attributes.
 
3) Car Price Prediction : The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. This dataset contains information about various cars, including their features and prices. The purpose of this dataset is to facilitate research and analysis in predicting car prices based on different attributes
 
4) Iris Flower Classification :
 The Iris Flower Classification dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. These flowers belong to three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.  The purpose of this dataset is to facilitate research and analysis in classifying the flower types based on different attributes .
